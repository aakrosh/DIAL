Most of the code in this package is written by Aakrosh Ratan (ratan@bx.psu.edu).

The code to create an index of the reads in several SFF files is written by Bob
Harris (bob@bx.psu.edu). Bob Harris is also the author of LASTZ, the aligner
used by DIAL to align the sequences to each other.

The "filter" module is written by Webb Miller (webb@bx.psu.edu). The module
imposes restrictions on the called SNPs, selecting a high confidence subset
suitable for use in genotyping assays.

"SuperFastHash" is created by Paul Hsieh and is the default hashing function in
the various modules. The details of the hash function can be found at
